* Estimating the Environmental Footprint of Data Centers and Contribution of Artificial Intelligence by using Macro-Level Analysis
** Introduction :
+ Pre-Neurla network ?: I think it would be better to put in the introduction a sentence that define what do you mean clearly when you talk about AI, what is the limits (a calculator, is it an AI?)
** Related works
+ Net Carbon Impact Assessmen + "t"
+ " First Order (direct emissions), Second Order (indirect usage effects) and Rebound Effects" --> it can be interesting to describe more these important notions
** Industrial initiative
+ DI think it will be cool to define the notion of "Scope 1-2-3" in the related work
+ I find the notion "clean energy" quiete strange, do you mean "carbon free energy"?
** Method
+ It would be better to explain with your formulas that "e" refers to the hardware under evaluation. Or maybe I misunderstand.
+ i think it's better to replace F_em by Electricity Grid Mix of the region g (EGM_g)
+ I dont understand what is I^(u)_eno(E) explain more. and I think the (PUE âˆ’ 1) is false becau PUE>=1 so you don't need the -1 (PUE=1.2 -> the equivalent of 20% of the power use for the computations are required for cooling,light...)
